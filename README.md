<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

City Search API
* only spent a couple of hours as requested so API and DataAccess tests are skeletoned and no actual database exists
to demonstrate what a complete project might look like
* Read SQLDataReader is a good way to read a large amount of data from a database, but if too slow would consider using a search engine either a custom trie search like
[https://github.com/RohitKaushal7/trie-search](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2015/10/20/text-pattern-search-trie-class-net.aspx) or elasticsearch


### Built With

.NetCore 7

## Getting Started

### Installation

It's really just a case of cloning the repo and hitting run, but the readme would look pretty dull, so for eg with authentication implemented:

1. (TODO) Get a free API Key
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/s-munsey/InternationalCitySearch.git
   ```
3. (TODO)Enter your API in `AppSettings.json`
